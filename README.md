# Relation Extration 

This software extract Work_For relation within text.


### Software dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shon-otmazgin/nlp_relation_extraction.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train:
To train our Relation Extraction model, please run ```train.py``` with 3 files:
1. ```corpus``` file in format of ```sentid<TAB>sent```
2. ```annotaion``` file in format of ```sentid<TAB>ent1<TAB>rel<TAB>ent2<TAB>```
3. ```vocab``` vectors file or SpaCy Vocab with vectors. We download ```glove.6B.300d.zip``` you can download it from [Here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) (right click), and extract it to ```data/glove.6B.300d.txt```.

Note: It may take a while, depending on your resources(cpu/gpu) and the size of the vectors file.

Example:
```python train.py data/Corpus.TRAIN.txt data/TRAIN.annotations data/glove.6B.300d.txt```

Program's output is 1 pickle file named ```trained_model```

### Extract Relations (Inference)
To get relations from trained model, please run ```extract.py``` with 2 files:
1. ```corpus``` file in format of ```sentid<TAB>sent```
2. ```output_file``` your desired output file name where the extracted relation will be written

Important Note: ```extract.py``` assume ```trained_model``` file exist in the content folder. Either train a model or download pre trained model from [Here]()

Example:
```python extract.py data/Corpus.DEV.txt relations.txt```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the results with gold annotations file please run ```eval.py``` with 2 files:
1. gold annotations in the format of ```sentid<TAB>ent1<TAB>rel<TAB>ent2<TAB>``` 
2. predicted relations in the format of ```sentid<TAB>ent1<TAB>rel<TAB>ent2<TAB>```

Example:
```python eval.py data/DEV.annotations relations.txt```

Program's output is the precision, recall and f1 scores.
